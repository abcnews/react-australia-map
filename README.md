# Electorate Map

A map of Australian electorates to use in conjunction with [@abcnews/scrollyteller](https://github.com/abcnews/scrollyteller).

## TODO

- pass a function to determine fill
- pass a function to run after svg setup (eg. to add defs, legend)
- pass a function to run after each update (eg. to update defs, legend)
- pass a function to determine label value (should every electorate get a label?)
